## Running the app locally

- Clone the repository locally
- From the root directory of this project
- Duplicate the `.env.example` file, renaming it to `.env`
  - Ask Diner for env var values required for development
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
  - To select the right runtime check the `.nvmrc` file, alternatively if you have node version manager (nvm) installed simply run the `nvm install` command
- Run the `npm install` command to install the projects dependencies
- Run the `npm run dev` command to build and run a development version of the app, it will then open in your default browser at http://localhost:4000

## Local database setup

- Make sure you have a valid `.env` file, the example DATABASE_URL environment variable will be used in this process
- Make sure you have docker installed from https://www.docker.com/
- Fill out `RW_TEST_USER_EMAIL` in .env with your own email address. This will help the Prisma seed function create a test account for you. The email needs to be valid as authentication works via a magic login email.
- To create the local database run `npm run db:up`
- To prepare the database with tables run `npx prisma migrate reset`
- To view the databases contents run `npm run db`

## Deploying to the staging environment

- Follow instructions [here](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) to set up Vercel CLI (you need to have an account in our Vercel team)
- Run `npx vercel deploy -- target staging`
